# [Chapter 2: Text Classification Fine Tuning](./notebooks/ch2-classification-fine-tuning.ipynb)

This is the fine-tuning section of [Chapter 2 - Text Classification](https://github.com/nlp-with-transformers/notebooks/blob/main/02_classification.ipynb).
I found the whole notebook wouldn't run in Kaggle on a P100, so this is a cut down version that trains the fine-tuned classifier.
